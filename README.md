Beat Saber Playlist Creation Tool by **Bloodcloak**

[Download](https://github.com/bloodcloak/noodleLister/releases/latest)

Really basic standalone python tool to create playlists. Requires internet connection and access to beatsaver.com.

## How to use
1. Download the exe and start the program
2. Enter a name for the playlist
3. Enter the playlist author name (you)
4. Select the cover image for the playlist.
    * Note: Accepts only png cover images and does NOT resize the image so needs to be square!
5. Create and select the text file with the map keys.
    * See the [example file](https://github.com/bloodcloak/noodleLister/blob/master/Example%20Song%20List.txt) for the format to give the program. List the map keys in the order you want them to appear, one per line.    
6. Press the Generate button and wait. It might say its not responding but it should still be working, especially if the playlist is very long.
7. The bplist file should be in the same folder as the program, ready for you to use.

This was just a fun side project to exercise my python skills. I'm most likely to not dive into more features until I have the time. However if you got an issue with the program let me know by creating an git issue!

Why noodles? Ramen Noodles are tasty! and because I'm a member of the Ramen Noodle Group.
